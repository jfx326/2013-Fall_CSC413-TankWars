# Tank Wars

Tank Wars is a simple, two-player, top-down shooter game that I developed as one of two final projects for my software development (CSC413) class in fall 2013. Tank Wars is developed and maintained in Java via Netbeans.

The other final project is a top-down shoot 'em up game called WingMan, which shares some classes and components with Tank Wars.

## Controls

Player 1 shoots with CTRL and moves with the arrow keys.  
Player 2 shoots with LEFT SHIFT and moves with W (up), A (left), S (down), D (right).

## Gameplay

The objective is simple: destroy your opponent!

### The Battlefield

The battlefield where the two players duel consists of lots of walls. Most of these walls are breakable and can be destroyed with a single shot; these breakable walls are the darker blocks on the battlefield. Also, although the breakable walls can be destroyed, they will regenerate after some time. Of course, they can be destroyed again. Consider this fact when planning your strategy against your opponent, whoever it may be!

Do also note the the large mini-map of the entire battlefield at the bottom of the screen!

### Health

Each player has health, and a health bar displayed above each player shows his or her remaining health. Additionally, each player has three lives; each player's number of lives are displayed, as small tank icons, right below each player. Once a player loses all three of his or her lives, his or her game is over, and he or she loses.

### Power-Ups

Aside from simply hunting your opponent and destroying his or her tank before he or she does to yours, scattered all over the battlefield are several power-ups that wil certainly tip the battle one way or another! Once a player obtains one of these power-ups, another one of the power-up in question will appear at another random location on the battlefield.

The boxes that have a picture of a tank are health boxes; pick them up to recover some health.

The blue spheres are shields; pick them up to protect yourself from losing health for a few shots — again, only a few shots!

The green spheres contain bounce rockets. Pick them up to upgrade your tank's barrel to fire these special rockets that bounce off walls a few times! However, do note that you only have 16 rockets, and that these rockets can hurt you, too, if you're not careful!

Lastly, the red spheres contain super rockets. Pick them up to upgrade you tank's barrel to fire these special rockets that easily pierce through breakable walls and seriously pack a punch — even destroying a shield almost instantly! You can only have, at most, 8 of these at a time.

Do note that you can only have one of each kind of special rocket. If you're using the super rockets and you pick up the bounce rockets, you lose the super rockets! The same goes the other way, too!

Good luck!
